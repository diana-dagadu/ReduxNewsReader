## REDUX NEWS READER PROJECT

* GOAL OF THE PROJECT
Task to complete the comments feature. Whenever the featured article changes, you will asynchronously fetch the comments for that article and add them to your store so they display under the article. Likewise, when a user submits a new comment, you will submit it to the server via an asynchronous request and display it in the articleâ€™s list of comments once it has been successfully created.
